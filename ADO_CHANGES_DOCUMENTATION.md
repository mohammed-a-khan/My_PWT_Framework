# ADO Integration Changes Documentation

## Overview
Changes made to fix Azure DevOps (ADO) integration for data-driven tests in both sequential and parallel execution modes.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. ADO Comments for Data-Driven Tests
**Problem**: ADO comments were showing generic "Test execution result: Failed" instead of detailed iteration information.

**Solution**:
- Modified deferred publishing to properly pass iteration data
- Limited comments to 1000 characters (ADO limit)
- Only included relevant data columns that were actually used in tests

### 2. Browser Reuse State Clearing
**Problem**: In sequential execution with browser reuse enabled, browser state wasn't properly cleared between iterations, causing tests to fail (user remained logged in).

**Solution**:
- Added proper context closure when BROWSER_REUSE_CLEAR_STATE=true
- Clear browserState to prevent cookie restoration
- Ensured complete isolation between test iterations

## Files Modified

### 1. src/ado/CSADODeferredPublisher.ts
**Changes**:
- Line 185: Added `iterationData: result.iterationData` to pass iteration data to publisher
- Lines 269-307: Modified `buildDataDrivenComment` method to:
  - Create concise comments within 1000 char limit
  - Only show first 3 data fields used in test
  - Show all iterations with pass/fail status until character limit reached

### 2. src/parallel/parallel-orchestrator.ts
**Changes**:
- Line 472: Added `isAggregated: true` flag to mark pre-aggregated results
- Lines 420-478: Modified to build concise iteration summaries with only first 3 data fields

### 3. src/bdd/CSBDDRunner.ts
**Changes**:
- Lines 2040-2058: Modified `performScenarioCleanup` to:
  - Clear browserState first to prevent cookie restoration
  - Close entire context (not just page) when BROWSER_REUSE_CLEAR_STATE=true
  - Ensure new context is created for next scenario

### 4. src/browser/CSBrowserManager.ts
**Changes**:
- Lines 536-545: Added `clearBrowserState()` method to clear stored browser state
- Prevents cookie restoration when new context is created

### 5. src/ado/CSADOPublisher.ts
**Changes**:
- Line 800: Fixed TypeScript error by using `this.config.shouldUploadAttachments()` instead of accessing private property

## Key Technical Details

### ADO Comment Format (Data-Driven Tests)
```
10 iterations: 8 passed, 2 failed

Iteration 1 [username:Admin, password:admin123, expectedResult:success]: PASS
Iteration 2 [username:user1, password:pass1, expectedResult:success]: FAIL
...
```

### Browser State Clearing Flow (Sequential)
1. Clear browserState to prevent cookie restoration
2. Close entire browser context
3. New context created automatically on next test

### Parallel Execution
- Each worker manages its own browser context
- Context isolation handled automatically
- ADO results aggregated from all workers

## Testing Commands

### Sequential Execution with Browser Reuse
```bash
env BROWSER_REUSE_ENABLED=true BROWSER_REUSE_CLEAR_STATE=true HEADLESS=true BROWSER_VIDEO=off \
npx ts-node --transpile-only src/index.ts --project=orangehrm \
--features=test/orangehrm/features/orangehrm-login-navigation.feature --tags="@login"
```

### Parallel Execution with ADO
```bash
env ADO_ENABLED=true ADO_DRY_RUN=true HEADLESS=true BROWSER_VIDEO=off \
npx ts-node --transpile-only src/index.ts --project=example-ado \
--features=test/example-ado/features/ado-data-driven-test.feature --parallel=true --workers=2
```

## Remaining Issues
- Browser state clearing in sequential execution still not working properly
- Tests timing out during CSBDDRunner import
- Need to investigate why context closure isn't working as expected
